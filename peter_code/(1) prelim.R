#' # Project: Distance to Food and Housing Prices
#' 
#' # Project Background
#' 
#' ## Project Description
#' This project investigates whether access to food, measured by distance 
#' to nearby grocery stores, affects housing prices. We focus on single 
#' households in Connecticut to explore the relationship between housing 
#' prices and access to food. 
#' 
#' ## Data Description
#' 
#' This project utilizes two main datasets: 
#' 
#' * (1) housing data for the state of Connecticut and 
#' * (2) a directory of stores authorized to accept SNAP benefits 
#' 
#' obtained from ATLAS. The housing data is in POLYGON format, while the 
#' store data includes longitude and latitude coordinates. By leveraging the 
#' spatial geometry of both datasets, we merged them using the `st_nearest()` 
#' function, which calculates the nearest points between the housing 
#' locations and stores based on their geographic coordinates.
#' 
#' ## Model Description
#' We will use a linear model to explore the relationship between housing 
#' prices and the following variables:
#' 
#' 1. **Rooms**: Bedrooms, bathrooms, half-baths, total rooms. We expect a 
#'    positive relationship between housing prices and the number of rooms.
#' 
#' 2. **Size**: Property size, where larger properties are expected to have 
#'    higher prices. However, we avoid farm properties by focusing on single 
#'    households to mitigate concerns about misclassification.
#' 
#' 3. **Zone Types**: Different zoning districts that regulate property use, 
#'    including whether commercial uses like restaurants are allowed. This 
#'    factor can influence housing prices.
#' 
#' 4. **Actual Year Built (AYB)**: Property age based on its actual year 
#'    built. We expect older properties may be less expensive, depending on 
#'    their renovations and current condition.
#' 
#' 5. **Condition**: Properties classified by condition (e.g., Excellent, 
#'    Poor) may show substantial variation in prices.

#' ## Import Libraries and Data
library(sf)

#' Load the dataset and drop unnecessary geometry for efficiency

# Load the Connecticut Property Shapefile
# d <- st_read("CT-parcel-data/4c5501b8-b68e-4888-bf6a-d92670d69c3b.gdb/")

# For Easy Data Handling
# d <- st_transform(d, crs = 4326)
# dng <- st_drop_geometry(d)  # Drop geometry data since it's not needed
# rm(d) # remove for efficiency
# names(dng) <- tolower(names(dng))  # Convert column names to lowercase

#' ## Exploratory Data Analysis
#' 
#' ### Assessed Total and Log-Transformation
#' Log-transforming the `assessed_total` variable helps achieve normality 
#' and produces better model results.
#' 

# filter out observations with less than 0 total values
head(dng[dng$assessed_total <= 0 | is.na(dng$assessed_total), ])  # off market? 
dng <- dng[!dng$assessed_total <= 0 | is.na(dng$assessed_total), ]

# There are many missing values.
# While I would hesitate to drop the missing values,
# this variable is important!
# in retrospect, this solves many other NA issues in other
# variables. 
sum(is.na(dng$assessed_total))
# Verify the following decision by Prof. Jay

# partially obviate its NA problem

#' ### Living Area

# Let's check the number of NA values in each var
sum(is.na(dng$eyb))

# While it is true that `eyb` provides other information than `ayb`. 
# The lack of consistency across the dataset may introduce other biases
# that we may not want in our data. Therefore, we do not consider `eyb` 
# in our dataset.

#' Is it going to be worthwhile to drop `ayb`? It seems to tell us
#' important information! We need to think more
